# Software requirements

- Python 3.8

# Getting started

Fenced code blocks
You can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks ``` before and after the code block. We recommend placing a blank line before and after code blocks to make the raw formatting easier to read.

```
git clone https://github.com/SebasGarcia08/horizontal-motion-physics/
cd horizontal-motion-physics && pip install .
python main.py
```
